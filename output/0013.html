Description
<br />
Over the recent years, data generated by humanities, scientific activities, as well as commercial applications from a diverse range of fields have been increasing exponentially. Data volumes of applications in the fields of sciences and engineering, finance, media, online information resources, etc. are expected to double every two years over the next decade and further. With this continuing data explosion, it is necessary to store and process data efficiently by utilizing enormous computing power that is available in the form of multi/manycore platforms. This increase in the demand for high performance large-scale data processing has necessitated collaboration and sharing of data collections among the world's leading education, research, and industrial institutions and use of distributed resources owned by collaborating parties. This kind of data intensive computing is posing many challenges in exploiting parallelism of current and upcoming computer architectures, such as automated data collection and provisioning, system monitoring and management, programming models, etc. Performance related aspects are becoming the bottlenecks for implementation, deployment and commercial application and its operation in data intensive computing system. The high performance data intensive computing paradigm also comes up with algorithmic and engineering issues such as performance aspects not yet eminent but expected to grow with their scaling of the large scale systems, and the dynamics of management. These new challenges may comprise, sometimes even deteriorate the performance, efficiency, and scalability of the dedicated data intensive computing systems.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
There is no doubt in the industry and research community that the importance of data intensive computing has been raising and will continue to be the foremost fields of research. This raise brings up many research issues, in forms of capturing and accessing data effectively and fast, processing it while still achieving high performance and high throughput, and storing it efficiently for future use. Programming for high performance yielding data intensive computing is an important challenging issue. Expressing data access requirements of applications and designing programming language abstractions to exploit parallelism are at immediate need. Application and domain specific optimizations are also parts of a viable solution in data intensive computing. While these are a few examples of issues, research in data intensive computing has become quite intense during the last few years yielding strong results. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Moreover, in a widely distributed environment, data is often not locally accessible and has thus to be remotely retrieved and stored. While traditional distributed systems work well for computation that requires limited data handling, they may fail in unexpected ways when the computation accesses, creates, and moves large amounts of data especially over wide-area networks. Further, data accessed and created is often poorly described, lacking both metadata and provenance. Scientists, researchers, and application developers are often forced to solve basic data-handling issues, such as physically locating data, how to access it, and/or how to move it to visualization and/or compute resources for further analysis. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
This workshop focuses on the challenges imposed by high performance data-intensive applications on distributed systems, and on the different state-of-the-art solutions proposed to overcome these challenges. It brought together the collaborative and distributed computing community and the data management community in an effort to generate productive conversations on the planning, management, and scheduling of data handling tasks and data storage resources.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
It is evident that data-intensive research is transforming computing landscape. We are facing the challenge of handling the deluge of data generated by sensors and modern instruments that are widely used in all domains. The number of sources of data is increasing, while, at the same time, the diversity, complexity and scale of these data resources are also growing dramatically.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
2012 International Workshop on High Performance Data Intensive Computing (HPDIC2012) is a forum for professionals involved in data intensive computing and high performance computing. The goal of this workshop is to bridge the gap between theory and practice in the field of high performance data intensive computing and bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry working on high performance data intensive computing technologies. We believe that high performance data intensive computing will benefit from close interaction between researchers and industry practitioners, so that the research can inform current deployments and deployment challenges can inform new research. In support of this, HPDIC2012 will provide a forum for both academics and industry practitioners to share their ideas and experiences, discuss challenges and recent advances, introduce developments and tools, identify open issues, present applications and enhancements for data intensive computing systems and report state-of-the-art and in-progress research, leverage each other's perspectives, and identify new/emerging trends in this important area.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
We therefore cordially invite contributions that investigate these issues, introduce new execution environments, apply performance evaluations and show the applicability to science and enterprise applications. We welcome various different kinds of papers that could formalize, simplify and optimize all the aspects of existing data intensive applications in science, engineering and business. We particularly encourage the submission of position papers that describe novel research directions and work that is in its formative stages, and papers about practical experiences and lessons learned from production systems.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Papers of applied research, industrial experience reports, work-in-progress and vision papers with different criteria for each category that describe recent advances and efforts in the design and development of data intensive computing, functionalities and capabilities that will benefit many applications are also solicited. The best presented paper will receive a BEST PAPER AWARD.
