<br />
<br />Hello from Google.
<br />
<br />As a Google Analytics customer, you've shown that you really care about  
<br />
attracting high-quality visitors to your website. That's why I'm writing:  
<br />
to suggest a way to attract even more.
<br />
<br />Your current customers most likely search for your business by name. But  
<br />
prospective customers tend to search by topic, such as &quot;real estate&quot;  
<br />
or &quot;florists&quot; or &quot;oil change.&quot; With an ad on Google, you can make it easy  
<br />
for people to find you using the words they choose.
<br />
<br />Getting started is easy.
<br />
<br />You can set your own budget and your own price for ads. As a Google  
<br />
Analytics customer, we're offering a limited guarantee: a refund of up to  
<br />
$400 if you're not happy with your ads and you close your account before 60  
<br />
days. To get this guarantee, be sure to enter the code below in  
<br />
the &quot;billing tab&quot; of your account within 14 days of running your first ad.
<br />
<br />Try an ad on Google and see if more customers find you. To redeem this  
<br />
offer go to google.com/ads/analytics or call 1-800-903-0288 before December  
<br />
31, 2012.
<br />

<br />
<br />Please use offer code: 4GQ6-H9ZD-JU83-NAZN-ABN. (Offer valid for new  
<br />
customers only.)
<br />
<br />Thanks for your partnership with Google.
<br />
