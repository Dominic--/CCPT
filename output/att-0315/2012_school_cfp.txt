       Call for Papers: AsiaFI 2012 Summer School

           Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.

The Internet is becoming the global digital infrastructure, however, its
design still faces many challenges. Many of these issues arose due to the
technology advances and drastic changes of the environment which bring
fundamental changes in the requirements. The Future Internet has become the
research theme for the global networking community to creating a better
digital environment for the future.

AsiaFI was established in 2008 for Future Internet research in Asia,
focusing on young researchers, especially those in the Asia Pacific region,
to be able to collaborate as we work toward this challenging topic. AsiaFI
is going to hold the AsiaFI Summer School, primarily for students in PhD
programs. The school provides opportunities for learning from world experts
about leading-edge technical topics, professional development (including
sessions on research and experimentation methodologies, writing and
presentation skills, etc.), and interpersonal networking. The school also
offers an excellent opportunity for young researchers to improve their
cross-cultural communication skills.



AsiaFI 2012 Summer School solicits papers that have obtained good results,
are posing questions, or are work-in-progress. Possible topics include, but
are not limited to:

- Architectures, protocols, and algorithms for Trust/Security Network,
Wired Network, Mobile/Wireless Network
- Modeling, measurement and simulation of networks
- Routing, Forwarding, Addressing, Identification and location
- Network management, Trust/Security management
- Mobile ad hoc and sensor networks/ Multi-hop wireless networks
- Delay (or Disruption) tolerant networks
- Wireless mesh networks and protocols
- Service and application management for Future Internet
- Implementations and experimental testbeds for Future Internet

[School Date]
August 21-23, 2012

[Venue]
Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan

[Registration fee (including School and Workshop)]
- 20,000 JPY (about 240 US dollars) for general
- 10,000 JPY (about 120 US dollars) for a full-time student


[Who should attend]
Researchers including Ph.D. students, young researchers who have
recently earned their Ph.D.s and advanced master course students who
are interested in Future Internet technologies are welcome. You will
be able to obtain supportive/productive comments and suggestions by
world-leading professors. These professors usually will not be
involved in the students' Ph.D. defense, allowing students to interact
freely, with fewer barriers.  While we welcome quality paper
submission, work-in-progress or even work-to-be-done type of
presentations are welcome as well provided they are interesting.



[Fellowship]
We will provide fellowship for best papers and for selected students
from developing countries; either full support or partial support. The
full support roughly covers airfare, room and board, and registration
fee, while the partial support covers only room and board and
registration fee.

We expect about 10 students to be rewarded but the exact number
depends on the available funding.


[How to Submit]
Paper submission and review will be done through EasyChair on the following link:

 http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=asiafi2012
 Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered.

 Paper submission has three categories:
  Work-in-progress papers (4 pages),
  Extended Abstract papers (2 pages).

Authors should state with their category of submission. Note that
Extended abstract papers will be assigned to lightning talk session
and poster session in the school. Other papers will be assigned to
presentation session.

Papers must be in two-column 10pt format.  Please use the following
LaTeX2e or MS Word templates.

Authors who will be accepted full or work-in-progress paper are encouraged
to submit poster session to extend discussion of your research.
