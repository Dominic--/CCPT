Advertise your website on Google
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Hello from Google! 
<br />
<br />Thanks for taking the time to set up your Google Analytics account. We hope our reports have started to provide you with valuable insights into how people are finding and interacting with your website.
<br />
<br />If you’re looking to drive even more people to your website, consider running an ad on Google with AdWords. 
<br />
<br /><br />Why advertise
<br />
<br />Your current customers likely search for your business by name (e.g. &quot;Brynn's Flower Shop&quot;) and, consequently, your listing shows up in their Google search results.
<br />
<br />Prospective customers, however, tend to search by topic and location (e.g. &quot;Wedding Flowers San Francisco&quot;) in which case your buisness listing may not show up among the top links.
<br />
<br />Quite often, prospective customers are looking for information you could easily provide in an ad – be it your expertise, this week's special offer, or the latest, most sought-after product. Also, AdWords integrates seamlessly with Analytics so you’ll be able to measure the impact of your advertising campaigns easily. 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Give it a go, on us
<br />
<br />Set up your ad before August 10, 2012 and we'll give you $100 in free advertising. Just use the code directly below. There's no obligation or commitment.
<br />
<br />Promo-code: 92FK-LD2S-SXEF-XNP8-3KPJ
<br />

<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />The Google Marketing team
