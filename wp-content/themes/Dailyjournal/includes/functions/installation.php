<span class="boldtext">Adding Your Title/Logo Image</span>
<div class="indent">
<p>In this theme the title/logo is an image, which means you will need an image editor to add your own text. You can do this by opening the blank logo image located at Photoshop Files/logo_blank.png, or by opening the logo PSD file located at Photoshop Files/logo.psd. Replace the edited logo with the old logo by placing it in the following directory: theme/LeanBiz/images, and naming the file "logo.png". If you need more room, or would like to edit the logo further, you can always do so by opening the original fully layered PSD file located at Photoshop Files/LeanBiz.psd</p>  </div>
